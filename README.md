<h1>Social Media App (Twitter clone)</h1>
<div>=>Created most of the routes exactly as it was mentioned but  i have made some changes according to my convinience which is not affecting the application at any level.

=>Some mistakes  that i realised later was i should have created the sidebar as i individual component to reduce code repetation and now due to time constraint i do not want to make any changes in my code.

=>rest comments  are there in code .

=> this project helped alot in my learning but the ecomm project was much much much tougher than this one so found it easy to code.

thank you .......</div>
